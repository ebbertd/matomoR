The goal of matomoR is to provide an R package that can used to query a Matomo server. This way the data can be processed further in R.

## Installation

The easiest way to get matomoR is to install it using the devtools:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ebbertd/matomoR")
```

## Status

The package is far from complete. I will only add functions once in a while depending on when I need them. Feel free to contribute.
